The [_Journal of the Photographic Society_][jps] is the journal for one of oldest photographic societies in the world: the [Royal Photographic Society][rps]. First published in 1853, the [_RPS Journal_][jps] is the oldest photographic periodical in the world (just edging out the [_British Journal of Photography_][bjp]).

So you can imagine my doubt when confronted with an email about using some material from [pixls.us](pixls.us) for their latest issue...

If the name sounds familiar to anyone it may be from a recent post by [Joe McNally][joemc] who is featured prominently in the September 2016 issue.  He [was also just inducted][joemcind] as a fellow into the society!

The editors liked the "Open Source Portrait" tutorial.  In particular, the section on using "Wavelet Decompose" to touch up the skin tones.
