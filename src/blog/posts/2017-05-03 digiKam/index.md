One of the goals we have here at PIXLS.US is to help Free Software projects however we can.
One of those ways is to focus on things that we can do well and that might help make things easier for the projects.
It may not be much fun for project developers to deal with websites or outreach necessarily.
This is something I think we can help with and recently we had an opportunity to do just that.

As part of a [post announcing the release of digiKam 5.5.0][]. we learned that they were [in need of a new webmaster][], and they needed something soon to migrate away from Drupal 6 for security reasons.
They had a rudimentary Drupal 7 theme setup, but it was severely lacking (non-responsive and not adapted to the existing content).

Mica (@paperdigits) reached out to the digiKam devs and offered our help, which they accepted!
At that point Mica gathered requirements from them and found in the end that a static website would be more than sufficient for their needs.


Helping the community in our own way...
