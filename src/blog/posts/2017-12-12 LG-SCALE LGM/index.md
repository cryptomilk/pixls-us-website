Libre Graphics Day: SCaLE 2018

Call for Participation

The libre graphics community is thrilled to announce that a special,
one-day track at SCaLE 16x will be dedicated to libre graphics
software and artists. All those who work with free and open-source
tools for creative graphics projects are invited to submit a proposal
and join us for the day!

SCaLE 16x will take place from March 8 to 11 of 2018 in Pasadena
California. Libre Graphics Day: SCaLE will take place at the main
SCaLE venue on Thursday, March 8.

The libre graphics track is an opportunity for teams, contributors and
practitioners involved in Libre Graphics projects to share their
experiences, showcase new developments, and hear new and inspiring ideas.

By libre graphics we mean “free, Libre and Open Source tools for
creative uses”.  Libre graphics is not just about software, but extends to
standards and file formats used in creative work.

People from around the world who are passionate about
Free/Libre tools and their creative applications are encouraged to
submit a talk proposal. Sessions will be 30 minutes in length.

Developers, artists, and activists alike are invited.  First-time
presenters and established projects of all sizes are welcome to submit.

We are looking for:
    ❧ Reflections and practical sessions on promoting the philosophy
    and use of Libre Graphics tools. 
    ❧ Technical presentations and workshops for developers.
    ❧ Showcases of excellent work made using Libre Graphics tools.
    ❧ New tools and workflows for graphics and code.
    ❧ Reflections on the activities of existing Free/Libre and Open Source communities.
Formats

The deadline for submissions is January 10th, 2018, and participants will be notified by the end of January 2018.
