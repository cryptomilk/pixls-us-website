For years the incredible team over at [G'MIC][] (GREYC's Magic for Image Computing) have been producing an incredible image processing system _and_ many awesome filters to go along with it.
They've got an very active and awesome community right here on [their forums][gmic-forum] and they've been producing all manner of neat processing filters for photographers, digital artists, and scientists.

Due to the project being under the auspices of a French Research Lab, the [GREYC][] laboratory in Caen, France, they were limited in being able to accept any donations.

**Until now!**

To avoid burying the lead, **go and make a donation** to the fabulous folks of the G'MIC project: **https://libreart.info/en/projects/gmic**.
