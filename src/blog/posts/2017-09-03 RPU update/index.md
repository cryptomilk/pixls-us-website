Our friendly neighborhood @LebedevRI pointed out to me a little while ago that we had reached some nice milestones for https://raw.pixls.us.
Not surprisingly I had spaced out and not written anything about it (or really any sort of social posts).  Bad Pat!

<!-- more -->

So let's talk about [raw.pixls.us][RPU] (RPU) a bit!

[RPU]: https://raw.pixls.us


## Recap

For anyone not familiar with RPU, a quick recap (we had previously [written about raw.pixls.us](https://pixls.us/blog/2017/01/new-year-new-raw-samples-website/) earlier this year).
There used to be a website for housing a repository of raw files for as many digital cameras as possible called [rawsamples.ch][].
It was created by Jakob Rohrbach and had been running since March of 2007.
Back in 2016 the site was hit with a SQL injection attack that left the Joomla database corrupted (in a teachable moment, the site also didn't have a database backup).

## Moar samples!

As @LebedevRI has said, we still really need folks to check [RPU][] and send us more samples!

* We currently only have [about 77% coverage](http://www.darktable.org/resources/camera-support/).
* We want to replace any non-[CC0][] (public domain) samples with [CC0][] licensed samples.
* We are still missing some rarer samples like any medium-format or Sigma samples.

We are really working hard to make sure we are a good resource of freely available raw samples for all Free Software imaging projects to use.
