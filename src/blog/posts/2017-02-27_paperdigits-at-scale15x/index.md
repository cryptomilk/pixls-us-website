The Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE) 15x is  returning to the Pasadena Convention Center March 2-5, 2017. SCaLE is one of the largest community-organized conferences in North America, with some 3,500 attendees last year.

If you're attending the conference this year, find me, [@paperdigits](https://discuss.pixls.us/users/paperdigits/activity) and lets talk shop or grab a meal!

If meeting isn't enough for you, I'll have stickers!
