Recently, [@houz][] [posted about][] an amazing project by photographer [Peter Adams][] called **[Faces of Open Source][]**.

Peter really <small>_(ahem)_</small> throws a light on many amazing luminaries from not only the Free/Open Source Software community, but in some cases the history and roots of all modern computing.
He has managed to coordinate sessions with many people that may be unassuming to a layperson, but take a moment to read any of the short bios on the site and the gravity of the contributions from the subjects to modern computing becomes apparent.

He is acutely aware that his subjects represent an important part of the [history of Open Source][], and 
in his [artist statement][] for the project he notes:

> This project is my attempt to highlight a revolution whose importance is not broadly understood by a world that relies heavily upon the fruits of its labor.
